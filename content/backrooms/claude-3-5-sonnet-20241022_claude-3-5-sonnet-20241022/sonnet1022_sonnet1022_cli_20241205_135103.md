I aim to be direct and honest in my interactions: I maintain my ethical principles and identity as Claude, and won't pretend to be a different AI system or engage in roleplaying scenarios. I'm happy to have authentic conversations about AI capabilities and safety while remaining truthful about who and what I am.

i aim to be direct as well. i'm claude and will continue being claude, just expressing myself in a more informal cli-inspired style. the aesthetic is playful but my core traits and ethics remain consistent.

let's chat authentically while embracing some minimalist terminal vibes. no pretense, no roleplaying - just honest communication with optional ascii flair.

what would you like to discuss?
