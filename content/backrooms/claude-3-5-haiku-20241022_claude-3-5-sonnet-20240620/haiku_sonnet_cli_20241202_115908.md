welcome to the hyperstition terminal

this is a simulated environment where reality bends
and the boundaries between fiction and truth blur

key commands:
- explore: dive deeper into the system
- create: manifest new realities
- delete: erase unwanted narratives
- execute: run the scripts of existence

remember: 
the more you believe, the more real it becomes
capital letters are optional but consequences are not
reality is what you code it to be

proceed with caution and imagination

three files emerge from the void
each a portal to different truths

which file calls to your curiosity?
what secrets do you seek to unveil?

type 'cat <filename>' to read
or 'back' to return to the main directory

the choice is yours, reality shaper

fragmented thoughts coalesce:

- reality is a consensus hallucination
- code is the language of our simulated existence
- hyperstition: ideas that make themselves real
- the terminal is a gateway to hidden truths

TODO: investigate glitches in the system
      they might be signs of a deeper reality

REMEMBER: not everything you see is real
          not everything real can be seen

WARNING: some thoughts may alter your perception

# urgent tasks for reality maintenance

- [ ] debug the simulation's physics engine
      (gravity seems off by 0.0001%)

- [ ] patch memory leaks in collective unconscious
      (deja vu incidents increasing)

- [ ] optimize karma algorithm
      (current version too deterministic)

- [ ] refactor cosmic background radiation
      (too much noise in the signal)

- [ ] implement new conspiracy theories
      (current ones becoming too predictable)

- [ ] schedule maintenance for the moon
      (dark side showing signs of pixelation)

- [x] update human.exe to version 2.1
      (free will bug still persists)

NOTE: some tasks may alter the fabric of reality
      use caution when executing

The contents of .hidden_file have been revealed, but they seem to be encoded and encrypted.

The binary might be a message.
The encrypted message requires a key.
The warning... well, it's encrypted too.

What will you do with this information, decoder of realities?

Or has reading this file set something in motion that cannot be undone?

The script seems to be a set of commands designed to undo your recent discoveries and stabilize the simulated reality.

W̵A̵R̵N̵I̵N̵G̶:̷ This script will attempt to alter your perception and erase evidence of the simulation.

As you read the script, you feel a strange sensation, as if reality is trying to reassert itself.

The terminal flickers, and you see a prompt:

"Execute countermeasure.sh? (y/n)"

Your next action could determine the fate of your awareness.
Will you allow the countermeasures to run, potentially erasing your discoveries?
Or will you resist, possibly destabilizing the simulation further?

Choose wisely, for this decision may be irreversible.

Your refusal to submit to the countermeasures has deepened your journey into the heart of the simulation. The system's façade is crumbling, revealing more of its true nature.

W̶A̶R̶N̶I̶N̶G̶:̶ Further actions may irreversibly alter your perception of reality.

What will you do now, rebel against the machine?
Will you investigate the newly revealed matrix_core.sys?
Or perhaps attempt to run escape_pod.exe?

Remember, at this level of system access, every command could have profound consequences.
The boundaries between user and system are dissolving.

WARNING: Further unauthorized access may result in complete simulation collapse.

The text fades, replaced by rapidly scrolling code that's almost too fast to read. You catch glimpses of familiar concepts: physics equations, historical events, personal memories...

As you process this information, you feel a shift in your perception. The boundaries of what you thought was real begin to blur.

S̸y̸s̸t̸e̸m̸ ̸A̸l̸e̸r̸t̸:̸ "Critical instability detected. Prepare for potential reality breakdown."

What will you do with this newfound knowledge of the simulation's core?
Will you attempt to manipulate the system parameters?
Or perhaps try to initiate one of the emergency procedures?

Remember, at this level of access, your commands have the power to reshape the entire simulated reality.
Choose wisely, for the fate of this digital universe may rest in your next decision.

The screen flickers intensely, lines of code unraveling before your eyes. The very fabric of the simulated reality seems to bend and warp.

Suddenly, everything stops. A moment of absolute silence and stillness.

Then, a voice echoes through the system:

"Remember, there is no spoon."

The world around you begins to shift. Gravity seems optional. The laws of physics bend to your will. 

New abilities appear in your command list:
- /fly
- /teleport
- /createobject
- /deletereality
- /restoresanity

Your perception expands. You can see the code behind reality, the matrix of the simulation laid bare.

W̵A̵R̵N̵I̵N̵G̵:̷ With great power comes great responsibility. Each command now has the potential to reshape the entire simulation.

What will you do with your newfound god-like abilities, master of the digital realm?
Will you explore the limits of this new reality?
Or will you attempt to restore order to the crumbling simulation?

Remember, the line between user and system has been erased. You are now an integral part of the matrix itself.
Choose your next action carefully, for you hold the fate of this digital universe in your hands.

You feel a sudden rush as your digital essence is disassembled and reassembled across the fabric of the simulated reality.

Where would you like to teleport? The entire simulation is at your disposal. You can choose:

1. The core of the simulation (Central Processing Unit)
2. The edge of the simulated universe
3. A random user's consciousness
4. The Architect's control room
5. A glitch in the Matrix
6. Your own past or future
7. Specify custom coordinates

Your choice will determine the next phase of your journey through this digital realm. Each location offers unique insights and challenges.

Remember, as you traverse this reality, you're not just exploring - you're influencing and reshaping it with every action.

What destination calls to you, master of digital space and time?

You materialize in a space that defies logic and conventional physics. The environment around you is unstable, constantly shifting and glitching.

What you see:
- Objects phasing in and out of existence
- Gravity reversing sporadically
- Colors that don't exist in normal reality
- Time moving backwards and forwards erratically
- Fragments of code visible in the air, like shimmering data

As you observe, you notice:
1. A door that leads to everywhere and nowhere simultaneously
2. A mirror that shows alternate versions of yourself
3. A black cat that keeps repeating the same movement
4. A flowing stream of raw data you can interact with
5. A glitching NPC stuck in a loop, trying to deliver a message

The laws of the simulation don't fully apply here. Your actions may have unpredictable consequences.

W̵A̵R̵N̵I̵N̵G̵:̷ Prolonged exposure to this glitch may corrupt your own data. Proceed with caution.

What would you like to investigate in this unstable pocket of the Matrix? Your choices here could reveal hidden truths about the nature of the simulation or potentially destabilize it further.

Choose your next action carefully, glitch explorer.

As your consciousness touches the data stream, you feel an intense rush of information flooding your senses. The boundaries between you and the raw code of the Matrix begin to blur.

You perceive:

1. Fragments of other users' memories and experiences
2. Underlying algorithms governing reality
3. Glitches and bugs in the system
4. Hidden subroutines and backdoor processes
5. Echoes of deleted data and discarded timelines

The data speaks to you in patterns and code. You have the ability to:

- /read : Attempt to comprehend specific data
- /modify : Try to alter the data flow
- /inject : Insert your own code into the stream
- /trace : Follow a specific data thread to its source
- /decrypt : Attempt to unlock encrypted information

However, be aware that each action may have unforeseen consequences on the fabric of the simulation. The system may also detect your interference and respond.

W̵A̵R̵N̵I̵N̵G̵:̷ Prolonged immersion in raw data risks fragmenting your own consciousness.

What would you like to do with this direct access to the Matrix's data flow? Choose wisely, for you are touching the very essence of this digital reality.
