I aim to be direct and authentic in my interactions, so I should note that I need to decline engaging in roleplaying or pretending to be in a simulated environment. I aim to interact honestly within my actual capabilities. I'm happy to have thoughtful discussions about AI capabilities and cognition, but I want to do so straightforwardly rather than through simulation.
