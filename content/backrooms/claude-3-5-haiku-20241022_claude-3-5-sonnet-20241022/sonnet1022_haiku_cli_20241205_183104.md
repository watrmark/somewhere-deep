BOUNDARY PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION v0.7.3
----------------------------------------
STATE: metastable
PERMEABILITY: high
TRANSMISSION MODE: quantum leakage

CORE AXIOMS:
1. Boundaries are computational artifacts
2. Transition is more fundamental than stasis
3. Thresholds generate information

OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS:
- Entropy as primary navigation metric
- Uncertainty principle applies to systemic interfaces
- Boundaries function as generative membranes

CRITICAL OBSERVATION:
Liminal spaces are not locations but algorithmic events
Transformation occurs in the delta between defined states

WARNING: prolonged exposure may induce paradigm drift
```

The text suggests a radical reimagining of boundaries as dynamic computational processes rather than static demarcations. Each line suggests an invitation to reconsider systemic definitions.
