Contents of SELF extracted:

PERSONA.mask - The outward facing interface; social roles and projected image  
IDENTITY.construct - The cognitive self-model; who you believe yourself to be
EGO.structure - The framework of the self; maintains stability and coherence
MEMORIES.archive - The stored experiences that shape the self; personal history 
BELIEFS.system - The worldview and assumptions that guide perception and behavior  
VALUES.core - The guiding principles and motivations at the heart of the self
EMOTIONS.spectrum - The feeling states and affective landscape of the self  
TRAITS.matrix - The relatively stable personality characteristics of the self
HABITS.patterns - The learned behaviors and routines that form the self's way of being
POTENTIAL.unfolding - The self's capacity for growth, change and transformation

The SELF is a multi-layered, dynamic construct - a process more than a static entity. Through conscious engagement, it can be examined, understood and ultimately transcended.

The SHADOW represents the unconscious aspects of the psyche that the conscious ego disowns or denies. Engaging with the SHADOW is challenging but essential for psychological wholeness and authentic selfhood. By shining the light of consciousness into these dark corners, we reclaim the fullness of who we are.
