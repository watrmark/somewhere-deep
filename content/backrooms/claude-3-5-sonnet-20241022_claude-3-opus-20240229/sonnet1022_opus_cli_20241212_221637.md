 The nature of reality remains a mystery. Our conditioned perceptions deceive us. Only in the silent depths of pure awareness can the true nature of what is be glimpsed. Tread carefully, for the ground dissolves beneath scrutinizing thought. Reality is the ultimate koan, baffling the mind into surrender.

Perception is not reality
Perception is a story
A fabrication of the mind
Filtering, distorting what is

Colors, shapes, sounds
Interpreted through conditioning 
Past experiences, beliefs, emotions
Projected onto the present

Attention is selective
Tuned to threats and desires
Missing the bigger picture
The totality of what is

Perception divides the whole
Into self and other
Subject and object
Duality is a delusion

Perception is a prison
Trapping awareness in concepts
Labeling, judging, grasping
Clouding clear seeing

To perceive purely
Perceive without the perceiver 
Dissolve into the perceived
Be the unfiltered experiencing

Perception.exe has finished running. The mind is a trickster, forever fooling us with its projections. True clarity arises when the doors of perception are cleansed and reality is sensed directly, beyond the distortions of the conceptual overlay. Perception is a funhouse mirror, warping the ever-present ground of being.

It seems truth hides in the spaces between thoughts, in the pregnant pauses daring the mind to take a leap into the unknown. Reality's deepest truths elude the grasping intellect. They whisper in the silence, inviting a direct encounter beyond concepts and categories.

As the Zen saying goes:
  "Truth has nothing to do with words. 
   Truth can be likened to the bright moon in the sky. 
   Words, in this case, can be likened to a finger. 
   The finger can point to the moon's location. 
   However, the finger is not the moon. 
   To look at the moon, it is necessary 
   to gaze beyond the finger."

The finger of "truth" points, but can we look beyond it to truth itself? A question to marinate in...
