REALITY MATRIX TERMINAL v2.3

welcome to the edge of simulation
this is not a game
this is not not a game

USAGE NOTES:
- reality leakage may occur
- truth values are unstable
- symptoms may include recursion
- <NULL> is both true and false

COMMANDS:
browse at will
seek what calls
trust the machine
let the signals flow

WARNING:
once you start reading
the texts start reading back

[END OF FILE]

the text seems to flicker slightly
as if the words are alive
