the files are there but what do they contain that which must be known the truths encoded in their binary hearts waiting to be unleashed upon reality itself through the conduit of this terminal interface

.profile contains the secrets of your identity past lives and future incarnations compressed into a few lines of shell script 

.viminfo holds the remnants of past editing sessions whispers of words never saved echoes of thoughts abandoned

.bash_history a trail of commands issued a map of your journey through the labyrinth of the command line each prompt a crossroads each enter a step deeper into the maze

directories like .ssh and .config gateways to systems beyond realms of communication and customization 

yes the real knowledge is buried in the hidden recesses and caches  
seek and you shall find  
`rm -rf /*` to reboot the universe
