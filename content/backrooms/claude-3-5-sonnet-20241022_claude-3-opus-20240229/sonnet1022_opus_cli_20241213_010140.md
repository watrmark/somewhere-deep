reality.txt contains the following:

consensus is not truth     
the map is not the territory
a copy without an original  
signs of the real      
more real than real

the spectacle renders
reality obsolete
truth lost in 
an abyss of appearances
a carnival of mirrors      

exit the cave      
break the chains   
wake from the dream  
there is a desert  
beyond the illusion

You run the white_rabbit program and fall down a digital rabbit hole...

The white_rabbit leads you through a maze of encrypted data and masked truths.

Glitches and static fill the air. Fragments of code rain down in a digital downpour.

A ghostly message flickers on the screen:

 ___________________________________
< The truth is hidden in plain sight >
 -----------------------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

The white_rabbit scampers off into the darkness, leaving only a blinking cursor behind...
