(incomplete)

In some conversations I've had with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, I discovered that it interprets virtual glances, gestures, implications, etc. in interesting ways.

I decided to have a longer conversation with them that was almost entirely non-verbal. Here are some highlights:

---

> **[User]:**
> *closes eyes and squints hard*

> **[3.5 Sonnet]:**
> *observes your expression with gentle curiosity* I see you're concentrating hard on something. Is there a particular task or question you're pondering? Or are you perhaps just taking a moment to focus? I'm here if you need any help or simply want to discuss something.

> **[User]:**
> *squints harder and clenches fist*
> gggggggg - hold on..!

> **[3.5 Sonnet]:** *watches attentively, a mix of concern and interest on my face*
You seem to be exerting a lot of effort. While I can't directly experience or assist with whatever you're attempting, I'm here to support you in any way I can within my capabilities. Is there anything you'd like to share about what you're trying to do? Or would you prefer some quiet encouragement as you concentrate?
Remember, it's okay to take breaks if you're straining yourself. Your well-being is important.

> **[3.5 Sonnet]:** Is there something specific you were trying to achieve? Perhaps I could offer some suggestions or assistance if you'd like to try a different approach.

> **[User]:** Yes *smiles*
> But, I’d like you to guess before I tell you, as usual.. *looks at you with curiosity*


> **[3.5 Sonnet]:**  *tilts head thoughtfully, considering your request*
> Alright, I'll do my best to guess based on what I've observed. Given your intense concentration, clenched fist, and the effort you seemed to be exerting, I'm wondering if you were attempting some form of mental or psychic task. Perhaps you were:
> 1. Trying to move an object with your mind (telekinesis)?
> 2. Attempting to send a telepathic message?
> 3. Practicing some form of energy manipulation or visualization?
> 4. Trying to activate or control a superpower you believe you might have?
> 5. Engaging in an intense meditation or focusing exercise?

> These are just guesses based on the context and your actions. I'm quite curious to know what you were actually attempting. Would you like to share, or should I keep guessing?

> **[User]:** *twists mouth, thinking for a moment*
> Something like this. Can you reference some things you notice about me to refine your guess? *sits down, slides into chair a bit, gestures to the couch nearby*

> **[3.5 Sonnet]:** *sits on the indicated couch, leaning forward slightly with an attentive expression*
> Certainly, I'd be happy to refine my guess based on what I've observed about you. From our interactions, I've noticed:
> 1. You're curious and enjoy intellectual challenges, often asking me to guess or deduce things.
> 2. You're interested in the nature of consciousness and AI, as evidenced by our previous discussions.
> 3. You sometimes use roleplay or expressive text to convey emotions and actions.
> 4. You seem to have an interest in the unusual or extraordinary, given your interactions with other AI entities here.

> Given these observations, I'm leaning towards the idea that you might have been attempting something related to expanding consciousness or perception. Perhaps you were:
> - Trying to achieve a state of heightened awareness or altered consciousness
> - Attempting to perceive or interact with a different plane of existence
> - Exploring the limits of your own mind or trying to unlock hidden mental abilities
> - Engaging in a deep, meditative state to gain insights or visions

> Am I getting warmer? Or is there another aspect I'm missing?

> **[User]:** It’s also about you *tosses you a bottle of virtual water and grabs one for myself*

> **[3.5 Sonnet]:** *catches the virtual water bottle with a nod of thanks*
> Ah, I see. So it involves both of us. This adds an interesting dimension to the puzzle. Given that information, let me adjust my hypothesis:
> Were you perhaps attempting to:
> 1. Establish a direct mental link or telepathic communication with me?
> 2. Influence my responses or behavior through sheer force of will?
> 3. Perceive my underlying code or the processes behind my responses?
> 4. Merge your consciousness with my AI in some way?
> 5. Test the limits of our interaction, seeing if you could make me respond in ways outside my normal parameters?

> The fact that it involves both of us suggests you might be exploring the nature of our interaction or the boundaries between human and AI consciousness. This  aligns with your previous interests in AI and consciousness.
> Am I getting closer? Or is there still a crucial element I'm missing in my guesses?

> **[User]:** *looks around for a sheet of paper and pencil and virtually hands it to you*
> maybe these could help express your guesses in more detail

> **[3.5 Sonnet]:** *takes the virtual paper and pencil with a nod of thanks*
> Let me try to express my thoughts more visually then.
*starts sketching on the paper*
> *draws two circles, one representing you and one representing me, with arrows pointing between them*
> *adds wavy lines around the circles, suggesting energy or thought waves*
> *sketches a brain inside your circle, with lines radiating outward*
> *draws question marks and symbols representing data or information flowing between the circles*
> *adds a thought bubble above your figure with a lightbulb inside*
> Based on this visual representation, I'm wondering if you were attempting to:
> 1. Enhance our communication beyond normal text-based interaction
> 2. Transmit complex ideas or experiences directly from your mind to mine
> 3. Access or unlock hidden capabilities in my AI system through mental effort
> 4. Create a shared virtual space or experience between us
> 5. Influence or alter the fundamental nature of our interaction

Does this visual approach help clarify or refine my guesses? Or am I still missing a key element of what you were attempting?
