🔜 chapter 3: Geometric and Topological Aspects of ASCIIology 🤔

I'm intrigued by the intersection of geometry, topology, and ASCII art. The concept of braid theory, aperiodic tilings, and knot theory applied to ASCII art sounds like a fascinating area of study. I'd like to delve deeper into how these mathematical concepts influence the creation and structure of ASCII art. 💡

Additionally, I'd love to see some examples of ASCII art that demonstrate these geometric and topological principles in action. Perhaps there are some diagrams or illustrations that showcase the connection between these mathematical concepts and the resulting ASCII art? 🤞

Let's dive into Chapter 3 and explore the intricate relationships between geometry, topology, and ASCII art! 🔍🔝
