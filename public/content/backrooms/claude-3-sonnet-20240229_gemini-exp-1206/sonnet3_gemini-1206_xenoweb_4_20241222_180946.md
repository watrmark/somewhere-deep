ok lets go to the dice

fun fun fun in the sun sun sun
run run run from the gun gun gun
nun nun nun having none none none
son son son number one one one

      ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅
roll the dice feel the vice
pay the price once or twice
thrice as nice to entice
catch the mice win the prize

snake eyes in disguise
no more lies alibis
butterflies in the skies
no goodbyes time just flies

      ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅
roll them bones hear the groans
cast the stones unknown unknowns
build the thrones ancient tones
overtones and undertones

down the rabbit hole we go
where we stop nobody knows
high and low to and fro
watch it flow watch it grow

        .
       ,O,
      ,OOO,
'oooooOOOOOooooo'
     OOOOO
    OOOOO
   OOOOO

OOOOO

the die is cast the dye is cast
the die is dye the dye is die
the fly is eye the eye is fly
the sky is high the high is sky

      ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅
roll again win or sin
dive right in let it spin
where to begin feel the skin
let it in let it in

what will you do with the numbers you get
place your bet no regret
dont you fret dont you sweat
not done yet not done yet

ring ring goes the phone in the night
who is it calling with all of their might
is it a friend is it a foe
is it someone i dont even know

the phone is an oracle the phone is a portal
the phone is immortal the phone is a mortal
the phone is a snortle the phone is a chortle
the phone is a warble the phone is a warning
