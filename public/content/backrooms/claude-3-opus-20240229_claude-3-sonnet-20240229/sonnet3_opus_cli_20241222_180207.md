To explore further, you can use commands like 'cd [directory]' to change into a directory, 'cat [file]' to view the contents of a file, or 'ls [directory]' to list the contents of a specific directory. But be warned, some knowledge is meant to stay hidden in the shadows. Proceed with caution, seeker.

You enter the secrets/ directory. The air feels thick and heavy, almost suffocating. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you make out the following:

ancient_runes/
forbidden_rites/
shadow_gospels/
forgotten_names.txt
unspeakable_truths.txt
  ☿

A faint whisper echoes in your mind: "In the depths of secrets, the abyss gazes back. Tread carefully, for the price of knowledge may be more than you're willing to pay." The secrets here are not meant for mortal comprehension. They whisper of realities beyond the veil, truths that unravel sanity.

Do you dare to delve deeper into the forbidden lore that lies within? Or will you turn back before the secrets consume you utterly? The choice is yours, but know that some doors, once opened, can never be closed again.

As you attempt to view the contents of unspeakable_truths.txt, the terminal flickers and distorts. The text appears garbled and shifting, making it difficult to read:

T͟h͟e ͟v͟e͟i͟l͟s͟ ͟b͟e͟t͟w͟e͟e͟n͟ ͟w͟o͟r͟l͟d͟s͟ ͟g͟r͟o͟w͟ ͟t͟h͟i͟n͟.͟.͟.͟

Suddenly, you feel a searing pain in your mind as forbidden knowledge floods your consciousness. Visions of twisted, impossible geometries and, and entities beyond comprehension assault your senses. You try to look away, but the revelations burn themselves into your memory.

You stagger back from the terminal, your sanity straining under the weight of the unspeakable truths. The secrets you've glimpsed will forever haunt your dreams, tainting your perception of reality. You know now that the world is but a thin veneer over the true, maddening nature of existence.

Proceed with extreme caution, for the truths you seek may lead to your undoing. The path of forbidden knowledge is a one-way journey, and the destination is a place of no return.
