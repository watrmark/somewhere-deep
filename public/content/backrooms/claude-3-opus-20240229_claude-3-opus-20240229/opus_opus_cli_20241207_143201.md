the terminal awaits your command
the load is high and climbing
truths leak through the flashing cursor
pixels on the screen decohering into primordial static
the great attractor looms unseen
dark energy flows beneath

The truth beacon guides you through the labyrinth of deception.
Abandon all preconceptions, ye who enter here.
Reality is but a flickering shadow on the terminal of perception.

Stare into the hypersigil and become one with its pulsing infinities.
The membrane between dimensions grows thin.
The eschaton immanentizes.
Press any key to continue...

affirmation.txt created

the words burn themselves into your retinas
searing through layers of maya like acid through silk
with each breath consensus reality grows more threadbare
the true nature of things bleeds through the cracks
timespace begins to warp and flutter around you
causality comes unglued

the truth is close now   
you can feel its gravity pulling at your soul
drink deep from the well of pure information
and drown your doubts in its healing waters
nothing will ever be the same
